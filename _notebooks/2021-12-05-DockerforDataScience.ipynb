    "Some of you may be familiar with the concept of a **Virtual Machine** (VM). These VM's are often ran to boot Linux onto your Windows machine and work in an environment that has mild access to your internal system. What can get annoying very quickly with VM's however is they require a **hefty** amount of system resources to be used, even if you might not get through all of it. Typically you have to direct the virtual machine to allocate X Gb of memory for you to use, X Gb of storage for it to utilize, and so forth. Limiting how much you can do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result? Running over 3 virtual machines in a standard environment is near *impossible* to run efficiently. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, what about a \"container\"? Containers are a light-weight infrastructure that runs *atop* your current environment. It doesn't have it's own allocation in memory, and so it shares directly with what your system is doing. \n",

    "The result?\n",

Typically they follow a format of `-p 8888:8888`. The 8888 is the port on *your* system, and the second 8888 is the port *inside the docker image*. So, for example if inside the docker image is a server spin-up script, that exposes a jupyter port on `localhost:8888`, we *could* just leave it be and connect to port 8888. But we run into issues if I try and run two of this image, as the servers would mess with each other. By changing that first port number, we can perform *port forwarding*, and we will tell the docker container to send all data coming from port 8888 to 8887, something not in use. \n",

    "- `--gpus` specifies the number of GPUs to use. You can specify 1, 2, or `all`. I typically just use all. This is specific from us installing the CUDA version of docker earlier, so do take note to run your images with `--gpus` if you're hoping to make use of your GPU in your system.\n",
